      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the   additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the   tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program   called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note   that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the   middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if   possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to   continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's   folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game   patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages.</p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Infinity Collection Portrait Pack for Windows is distributed   as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU   installer. To   install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on   screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cd_icpp.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>cd_icpp</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cd_icpp.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cd_icpp.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Infinity Collection Portrait Pack for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cd_icpp</strong>, <strong>setup-cd_icpp.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>cd_icpp</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cd_icpp.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cd_icpp.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Infinity Collection Portrait Pack for Linux is distributed as a   compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer. Linux users   will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>.</p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall cd_icpp in your game folder.</p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual   components, you can completely uninstall the mod using   setup-cd_icpp --uninstall at the command line to remove all   components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>This is a collection of more than 150 portraits to be used by the PC in any Infinity Engine game (including Enhanced Editions) except the original and Enhanced Edition of Planescape: Torment. It does not include any portraits offered in the purchasable DLCs. The portraits can be previewed on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/37-infinity-collection-portrait-pack/">Infinity Collection Portrait Pack page</a>. </p>
      <p>There are four components, allowing you to install portraits from each of the four portrait sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Baldur's Gate: </strong>This includes all portraits from the original Baldur's Gate (both NPC and PC portraits), as well as the new NPCs and portraits from the Enhanced Edition and Siege of Dragonspear expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>Baldur's Gate II:</strong> This includes all portraits from the original Baldur's Gate II (both NPC and PC portraits) including the Throne of Bhaal expansion, plus the new NPCs and portraits from the Enhanced Edition.</li>
        <li><strong>Icewind Dale: </strong>Since Icewind Dale II included all Icewind Dale portraits by default, these portraits are presented as a binary option. You can choose to install only the portraits from Icewind Dale (including Enhanced Edition portraits) OR the portraits from Icewind Dale II since it includes the Icewind Dale portraits. Essentially it's a choice of IWD vs. IWD &amp; IWD2.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is overlap between Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II options, but each has some exclusive portraits. This is why they are presented as separate options instead of the way that the IWD portraits are presented.</p>

      <p>The idea for this mod came about during a project to revamp and modernize other G3 portrait packs and make them available as player portraits for all games. It was a pretty straightforward process as the code was more or less already written, and all that was needed was some extraction and Photoshop work.</p>

      <p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 20 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together.</p>
      <p>There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
        work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
        from the author(s).</p>
      <p>Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either.</p>
